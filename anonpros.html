<h1>Benefits of being Anonymous</h1>
<p>Some benfits with anonymity is having an online community where you feel safe and comfortable speaking
about topics that are important to you. For example, you are able to connect with people who either are apart of the
same community such as the LGBTQ+ community. Young teens or adults are able to communicate on issues that are facing in their
everyday life with their unaccepting or accepting enviornment that they are living in. And also connect with others in either
the same country or internationally! This is a way for young teens to connect and build stronger relationships.</p>

<h2>Reporting and Controvesial Opinions</h2>
<p>Being anonymous can also benefit the ability to talk about controvesial opinions and also report content that is not
approriate for the general public. This way you can talk about opinions that you feel you would generally get backlash for
from people you know or from the community around you. Also reporting can also help with being able to report content that
that is not approriate as stated before which is harmful to the public and to whatever topics that might seem offensive.</p>
