  <!--Here is a header (h1). It talks about the benefits of being anonymous. The paragraph below has some general information about it. -->
<h1>Benefits of being Anonymous</h1>
<p>Some benfits with anonymity is having an online community where you feel safe and comfortable speaking
about topics that are important to you. For example, you are able to connect with people who either are apart of the
same community such as the LGBTQ+ community. Young teens or adults are able to communicate regarding issues they are facing in their
everyday lives, such as the environments they live in and whether or not they're accepted. They can also connect with others in either
the same country or internationally! This is a way for young teens to connect and build stronger relationships.</p>

<h2>Reporting and Controvesial Opinions</h2>
<p>Being anonymous can also benefit the ability to talk about controvesial opinions and also report crimes anonymously.
  This way you can talk about opinions that you feel you would generally get backlash for
from people you know or from the community around you. Also, people afraid of coming forward for fear of
political backlash, safety and pride can give vital information to news sources and police anonymously.</p>
