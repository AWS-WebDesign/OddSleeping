  <h1><strong> 🌧🍃the causes of climate change 🌧🍃</strong></h1>
  <p> the cause of climate change over the past few years can raidply changed our different ecosystems in different parts of the world.
    For example, over the past few years, we have developed in an understanding of what climate change is. Over the course of time, different ecosystems in parts of the world have been effected.
  A well known situation is with how ice is melting in the North Pole which effects the ecosystem of the native animals that live there.
  Polar Bears have been the major impact in the falling of their ecosystem and rely on the ice as apart of their home and use it for different aspects of their live including hunting, mating, shelter, and many more.
  Nowadays, people are taking active steps into change what we can't undo in the future. With the motivation to protect our planet and reserve our ecosystems, the earth will benefit from it and in return help us with our enviroment.

<div class="deforestation">
<h1><strong> 🌿⛈✨deforestation🌿⛈✨</strong></h1>
<p> Deforestation, as we know, is the act of clearing landing trees. Experts say that Deforestation is the second leading cause of Climate change.
With the act of deforestatiom, most ecosystems are destroyed for animals, some animals are able to move and restart but others aren't given that ability to move and die.
But, there are different ways, you can help protect the animals ecosystems but also save our forests that bring us oxygen that we need to breathe.</p>
