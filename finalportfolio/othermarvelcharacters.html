  <p><center>Loki is the younger brother of Thor and he creates a lot of trouble for the Avengers. His presence is major in the first avengers movie when he attacked New York City in the first avengers movie!.
    He is the god of mischef and his powers are super complex and limitless!. His backstory is sad and has really shaped into the man he is today. His relationships with his parents were complicated, his mother
    really cared for him and wanted the best for him. While, his father had turned onto him and became emotionally abusive towards him and cared for his older brother Thor more. Also to mention, he is adopted
    into the family when he was found in a plant where Frost giants live and he was taken and grew up with Thor and his mother and father. He's father essentially lied to him about the Frost Giants which caused even more
  damage to him resolving in him becoming a villian. </p></center>
