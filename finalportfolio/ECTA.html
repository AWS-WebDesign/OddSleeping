<!-- this webpage has one our first projects where we talk about enviornmental call to action and I talked about protecting environments for animals. And
I mentioned climate change, deforestation, and many other factors that damage animals enviornments and can cause them to lose their homes. And here, I created
this webpage to be able to summarize what exactly the webpage is about and it also includes a link where you can access the actual project.-->
