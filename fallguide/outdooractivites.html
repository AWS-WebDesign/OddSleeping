get some food if you're feeling hungry. Most of the food is similar to fair food and
if you're not a fan of it you can grab food in the candy station inside where you can also by
a smoothie if you're feeling a bit thristy. Also if you feel more in the mood for a game, you can
head over to the corn maze where you can potentinally get lost in the maze and waste time trying to
