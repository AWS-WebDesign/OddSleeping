<h1> ☕️Visiting Your Local Starbucks☕️</h1>

<p>
  Something I like to do during the fall season or heading into the Halloween/Spooky Season is visiting Starbucks!.
  I understand that it might not be super exciting but tasting this particular brings a lot of joy to me and my day.
I really like the Salted Caramel Mocha from Starbucks because I really like the blend of chocolate, caramel, and coffee mixed together
and topped with whipped cream and salt. You can also try to the other seasonal drinks that shop has to offer!.</p>

  <h1>✨🐶Visiting a Dog Shelter✨🐶</h1>
  <p> This fall season you can visit your local dog shelter or animal shelter to adopt a furry friend to
  keep you happy. I had adopted my dog from a shelter in the spring time but it is totally worth taking care of this
furry friend. But, be sure to be able to take care of the animal before you have the dog or cat!</p>
