    <p>Anonymity undoubtedly has its perks. When you first create that anonymous account, you are virtually free to
      say anything to the internet world without having any reprocussions.
       However, there's always another side to the coin. Are the risks of anonymity
    worth the rewards? In this section, we'll discuss the drawbacks of anonymity, which often manifest in the form of
  hate crimes, cyberbulling, illegal discussions and child trafficking. </p>

<!--Inside is just two paragraphs (p) about anominity. -->
<p>Internet users value our anonimity. According to a Pew Research study, 68% of internet users
think their privacy is not protected enough online. 50% of users are worried about how much information
about them is online. The most important thing to keep hidden to them is their email information.
</p>
<p>You may be thinking this has more to do with privacy. However, the two are closely related.
One cyber security store put it this way: privacy is when users know who you are but cannot see what you
type or do, while anonymity is when users can see what you do, but don't know who you are. </p>

<!--This is a span - I used it instead of a paragraph because spans tend to be more compact. It describes some of the youtube
drama. I put a break in the middle of it to act as a return key. The breaks at the end are for spacing.  -->
<span>The internet responded swiftly with hate for James. More hate comments began to
build, with more and more internet users jumping on the hate bandwagon without learning the facts.
After he posted an apology video, all of the commenters switched sides and deleted all of their
hate comments. They were able to bully him to the point of self-hatred and then immediately change sides
when the truth was revealed. <br>By hiding behind their screens, they could do all of it without consequence. </span> <br> <br> <br>
<!--This div is for the screenshots of comments from youtube videos. I gave it the class cyberbully so the background is dark grey. I did

  <!--Here is a regular paragraph. -->
  <p>All of this controversy came from a false accusation, but ballooned into a flurr
  of hate comments that greatly impacted one Youtuber's life. Youtubers are in the position where millions of
people anonymously decide whether or not they're liked or not. Being hidden behind the screen makes them malicious
without thinking of the consequences of their words. </p>
